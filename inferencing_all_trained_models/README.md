# Inferencing the Models 

This directory contains two subdirectories:
- [all_models_used_with_langchain](https://github.com/REELICIT/reqbrain_rep_package/tree/8a4d0c3b81ee4f70b72d1d6cec351a0ee2383cc0/inferencing_all_trained_models/all_models_used_with_langchain) contains five ipynb scripts, each dedicated to setting up the five trained model with LangChain for demo.
- [data_science_experiment_for_RQs_2_3_4](https://github.com/REELICIT/reqbrain_rep_package/tree/8a4d0c3b81ee4f70b72d1d6cec351a0ee2383cc0/inferencing_all_trained_models/data_science_experiment_for_RQs_2_3_4) **encompasses the results of the experiment conducted for RQ 2, 3, and 4 as detailed in the paper**.


## What is LangChain?
LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models. To learn more about LangChain click [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction).
