# Inferencing the Models 

This directory contains two subdirectories:
- **data_science_experiment_for_RQs_2_3_4:** encompasses the results of the experiment conducted for RQ 2, 3, and 4 as detailed in the paper.
- **all_models_used_with_langchain:** contains five ipynb scripts, each dedicated to setting up the five trained model with LangChain for demo. These are for demo!



## What is LangChain?
