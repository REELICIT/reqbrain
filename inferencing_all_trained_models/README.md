# Inferencing the Models 

This directory contains two subdirectories:
- [all_models_used_with_langchain](https://github.com/REELICIT/reqbrain_rep_package/tree/94904b061acb24706c26e93a088ee48dc49ff80d/inferencing_all_trained_models/all_models_used_with_langchain) contains five ipynb scripts, each dedicated to setting up the five trained model with LangChain for demo.
- [data_science_experiment_for_RQs_2_3_4](https://github.com/REELICIT/reqbrain_rep_package/tree/94904b061acb24706c26e93a088ee48dc49ff80d/inferencing_all_trained_models/data_science_experiment_for_RQs_2_3_4) **encompasses the results of the experiment conducted for RQ 2, 3, and 4 as detailed in the paper**.


## What is LangChain?
