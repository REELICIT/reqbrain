# Results For RQ1

This directory contains the script for all necessary numerical evaluations used in the paper.

- [dataset_for_spider_chart](https://github.com/REELICIT/reqbrain_rep_package/tree/3c5d4409e33d7fb86c6ca19829f05db481f6699d/evaluation_scripts/dataset_for_spider_chart) is a copy of the evaluation set with extra columns used for spider chart used for the numerical evaluation part.
- [predicting_with_models](https://github.com/REELICIT/reqbrain_rep_package/tree/3c5d4409e33d7fb86c6ca19829f05db481f6699d/evaluation_scripts/predicting_with_models) contains one script per model. Each script apply a model on the evaluation set and store its result in a copy of the dataset [models_prediction_dataset](https://github.com/REELICIT/reqbrain_rep_package/tree/3c5d4409e33d7fb86c6ca19829f05db481f6699d/evaluation_scripts/predicting_with_models/models_prediction_dataset) within the directory.
